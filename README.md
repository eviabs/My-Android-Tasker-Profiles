# My Android Tasker Profiles
These are my own Takser profiles. I have created them to automate my daily rutine, to extends my control over my Android device, and to customize the look and feel of my Android device. Some of them require root, and some of them require 3rd-party Android apps.

You are welcome to import any of my profiles, modify them and use them.

# Profiles
Each profile is located in a seperate *folder* and has its own *README* file.

## Adding a Profile
To add a profile, place the `.prj.xml` file on your sd card. Then open Tasker, long press on an existing profile and then press import:
