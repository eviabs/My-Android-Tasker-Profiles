# Screenshots Edit

Some Android phones don't provide a built-in screenshot editor (like my olf HTC 10).

This profile lets you edit any screenshot the moment it is taken. The profile sends the screenshot taken by you to an external editor app.

## Requirments
You need to install the editor app - [Snipping Tool - Screenshot Touch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anhlt.sniptool&hl=en) - to make it work.

You also need to install the Tasker plugin [AutoNotification](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autonotification).
